# DataScience-Sorting_and_Iterating_Large_Data
 Sorting large genetic data to improve iteration processing time. This is a use of merge sorting to compile a count of genes that meet the intron and exon requirement in short amount of time. The unsorted data can take upwards of 1.5 hours to output results but the sorted taked outputs results in less than a minutes. Project completed using Python and Jupyter Notebook
